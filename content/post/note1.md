![potate](https://i.imgur.com/lqYH8Ri.jpeg)

using magit to manage the git on this
testing it out. trying to get used to emacs

argg i hate rebabasing and fast forwarding
git merge conflicts are such a headache
it sucks so much
when you accidentally push before pulling

- okay this time il try magit again

- editing it on github to test pulling from magit
trying to push again from here *******
